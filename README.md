## RVNL Stock Forecasting and Trading Strategy using LSTM, Transformer, and XGBoost
This project presents a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for stock price forecasting and trading signal generation, specifically applied to RVNL (Rail Vikas Nigam Limited) — a mid-cap equity listed on the Indian NSE. The framework combines deep learning models (LSTM, Transformer) with XGBoost, technical indicators, and interpretable AI techniques such as SHAP and attention heatmaps.

🔒 This repository will be made public upon acceptance of the accompanying research paper submitted to an ACM international conference.
